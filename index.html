<h4> Some things I've made </h4>

<i>Note: I created a large project over the summer last year for <a href="http://www.ridgebackcap.com/">Ridgeback Capital</a> using Elasticsearch and AWS. The project was internal so unfortunately I can't share it here. </i>

<ul>
<li> <a href="http://static.hherman.com/catan"> Settlers of Catan.</a> A web version of the board game "Settlers of Catan." Group project from my sophomore year in college. The source code is <a href="https://github.com/hherman1/CatanClient"> here</a>.</li>
<li> <a href="https://github.com/hherman1/PersonalGraphics"> 3d graphics project.</a> Project from "3D programming" course in junior year. Mostly implemented by myself. Includes features like deferred rendering, shadows, normal mapping, and a fluid simulation. </li>

<li> <a href="https://github.com/hherman1/NetworkScience"> Network Science Project</a>. Small project, mostly a task of scraping data from the web and processing it in both R and Gephi. </li>
<li> <a href="https://github.com/hherman1/TDA">Topology Project</a>. Small project, mostly a task of cleaning, parsing, and manipulating reasonably large (20MB) data sets for analysis. </li>
<li> <a href="https://github.com/hherman1/macalester-schedule-search">Macalester Schedule search</a>. Small project, uses <u>Elasticsearch</u> and <u>NodeJS</u> to scrape the macalester fall schedule, upload the data to an ES server, and then allows me to search classes in a much more convenient fashion. </li>
<li> <a href="https://github.com/hherman1/intern-dev-project"> Internship application project</a>. This is a small project I completed to apply for my internship at Ridgeback Capital. Unfortunately, and perhaps frustratingly, its offline right now. You'll have to take my word that it worked as intended! </li>
<li> <a href="http://grinnelldesigns.com/#home">Grinell Designs Homepage</a>. Just a web design project. I wasn't a fan of having the images on the landing page be buttons, but this was important to my employer. </li>
<li> <a href="https://github.com/hherman1/Personal-DB-Ui">DB UI</a>. This is a project I worked on years ago in highschool for a Systems programming course. Its a terminal based user interface for a provided "database". It was a really fun project, and as you can tell from the commits, I worked very hard on it. Looking back on it I'm actually impressed by the scope of it, it kind of exceeds some of the work I'm expected to complete today. </li>
<li> <a href="https://github.com/hherman1/xtermDoodle">Terminal Doodle Jump</a>. This is another project from Systems in highschool. Smaller, but still neat. Its an implementation of the iOS game Doodle Jump in terminal. It was fun to make. </li>
</ul>

<h4> Other things on this site </h4>

<ul>
    <li><a href="http://static.hherman.com/leaveAMessage">Leave a Message</a>. This is a tiny app written in Go on the backend and Typescript on the frontend. Its inspired by a website (who's name I've forgotten) which would let you upload a link, and then redirect you to whatever link was last uploaded. The only difference is that this just passes messages. </li>
    <li><a href="https://www.hherman.com/townSquare/index.html">Town Square</a>. Another toy app in Go and TypeScript. It's a 2D 'physical' and ephemeral chat room. My dream was to have a ton of people in here and see what happens.  </li>
</ul>
